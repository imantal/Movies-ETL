# Movies-ETL
## Background
The objective is to create an automated pipeline that takes in some movies data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into SQL tables. A  function is created that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
